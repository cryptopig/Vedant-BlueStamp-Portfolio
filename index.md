# LitterBot
Hello! I'm Vedant from Adrian C. Wilcox High School. My projet is a litter cleaning robot that's designed to clean trash off the sides of streets. It's built with a Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and uses Computer Vision to detect various litter pieces apart.

# Starter Project

My first milestone was about my starter project, the jitterbug. It was good practice for soldering skills. 
#### Parts: 
JitterBug PCB, Coin Cell Battery, Red LEDs, ERM Vibration Motor, Slide Switch, Tinned Copper Wire

#### How it works: 
The circuit is powered by the small coin cell battery in the center. It conducts electricity into a metal battery holder, which powers the vibration motor and LED. A switch in the middle of the jitterbug allows current through the circuit if turned on. There are also some metal wires that act as legs for the jitterbug. 

#### Circuit Diagram:
![Jitterbug Diagram](JitterbugCircuitDiagram.png)
Shown above is the circuit diagram for this starter project. As illustrated, there is a series of parallel connections all powered by the cell battery. 

### Challenges:
The main goal of this project was to practice soldering small wires; the hardest soldering joint was probably the wires of the cell battery, as the joint was miniscule and I risked burning the rubber around the extremely thin wire.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
